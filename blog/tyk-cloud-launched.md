# Announcing Tyk Cloud

It's hapened, finally. 

Today we're happy to announce that Tyk is growing up, and that we've launched a cloud-based version of it. 

[Tyk Cloud](https://cloud.tyk.io) is all the best bits of tyk, managed and deployed and supported by us. It's free to use and is a great way for new users to get started with API Management.

## What will happen to the open source version?

That's the beauty of this - we are offering a hosted version of Tyk, it only has minor differences, and major changes and new features are pushed to the open source and freely downloadable versions of the product - **development will not stop**.

It will accellarate though. 

A cloud platform means users can get up and running quickly, can trial Tyk without needing an install, or manage their own Redis cluster or MongoDB back-end, we take care of all of that. We've also made sure that our usage tiers are fair, easily accessible and do not have eye-watering prices.

It's a pretty big change, for those that have followed Tyk since our initial version, you'll know that we went from an open sourced / licensed model, to a support based but free model quite quickly, the change from closed to free really helped us get traction, and most importantly, build a community. Moving Tyk to the cloud is a natural evolution for the project, and a great technical showcase of what it can do.

Tyk Cloud is entirely built using the Tyk REST API and the Tyk Advanced Management API, so as a proof of concept and as a test-bed it is an excellent way for us to innovate and continue to evolve the product for our community.

If you'd like an invite code, there's a [lovely little form here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1K9QHfhHsPvKEVnmEMH8otzXzcPZtAmyxUhAqhNnN0TE/viewform?c=0&w=1) to apply - I hope you are too :-)

Cheers,
Martin
